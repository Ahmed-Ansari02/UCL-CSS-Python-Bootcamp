# UCL-CSS-Python-Bootcamp üêç

This is a repository for the UCL CSS Python Bootcamp. All the code examples, exercises and slides from the bootcamp tutorials will be found within the relevant week's folder.

This course is based on the excellent book by **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python** by **Al Sweigart**. You can access the free to read copy of this book [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). It is recommended that you try the practice questions/projects to help you apply and test your skills.

Just as a reminder, on this repository you can find the lecture notes in pptx and pdf format and the Python files for the projects covered in class. Content for each week can be found under the directory of that week. Happy learning! ü•≥
